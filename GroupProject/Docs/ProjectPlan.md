# Project Plan

**Author**: Team 4

# 1. Introduction

_GroceryListManager_ is an Android app that allows the user to keep track of grocery lists.
The app is a single-user app.

# 2. Process Description

Standard software engineering processes are being followed during product development.
Team followed following activities during processes. Enterance and exit criterias are summarized version of all activities.

## Requirement Gathering / Software Specification

This process defines the functionality of the software and constraints on its operation.
The activity defines the data that have been gathered through the detailed study into a document that have a set of requirements.

- Project overview

  - Have the team review the scope, business logic, constraints, and requirements for the application.
  - Find out the requirements for the application.

- Design initial use case model

  - Create a use case model to explore potential user and what the system will do for each of the user.
  - Understanding of the project scope and requirements.
  - When the design of the use case diagram explores all the requirements and potential user.

- Compile extra/supplementary requirements

  - Explain the set of extra requirements for the project. Including non-functional requirements.
  - Understanding of the project scope and requirements.
  - When the necessary extra requirements are explained.

Entrance criteria: Client discussion, requirement document and modeling of the use case diagram.

Exit criteria: Well documented satisfactory functional/non-funtional and supplementary requirements.

## Analysis and Design

This process focus on detailed analysis and iterative design of the system.

Use-case, class model, architectural and component diagram are produced with a testing plan document.

- Create Low Level Design

  - Create the initial low level design model(s). To provide details and describe the internal structures of the system's components
  - Once we have completed the architectural design models.
  - When we have finished the class diagram and any other diagram like a component diagram to explain the structure of components.

- Create Architectural Design

  - Create the initial architectural design model. To explain the elements of the application and how these elements will interact in a high-level view.
  - Completed initial use case model diagram
  - When we have designed the component diagram and the deployment diagram. And when these models can explain how all the components of the system interact as designed.

- Create User Interface Design

  - Create the initial user interface design of the application. To show how the user will interact with the system and how they will navigate through it.
  - Once we have completed the architectural design and the class diagram.
  - When we have designed an experience that allows the users to complete all the requirements and navigate through the system.

Entrance criteria: Requirement gathering activity is completed

Exit Criteria: All project specific use-case, class, architectural and component diagrams/models and testing plan documents are delivered.

## Software Development / Implementation

This process triggers the implementation of defined software/product as per generated design documents.

- Building an initial prototype
  - Using the previous models and requirements to build a prototype version of the application.
  - Once we have created the necessary test cases and recorded their intended results.
  - When we have a working version of the application that passes all test cases.

Entrance criteria: Design activity is completed.

Exit Criteria: Initial product version is released

## Testing / Validation

This process tests the functional requirements.

- Design testing strategy

  - Create a testing strategy that will be used throughout the development of the application. As well as the initial test cases that will be used during the development
  - Once we have an understanding of the use case model and how elements in the application will interact.
  - When we have finished creating test cases and recording their purpose and intended results.

Entrance criteria: Right after implementation process

Exit criteria: Once testing is finished

## Deployment

The process triggers the software deployment.

Entrance criteria: Testing/Validation process is successfully done.

Exit criteria: Production version of the product is availble.
